# Shortcodes

Shortcodes is an add-on for Concrete CMS that allows you to define custom placeholders within your page content, which are dynamically resolved at runtime. This package is a modern redevelopment of the original Shortcodes add-on by A3020, whose development was discontinued in 2021. The new version has been completely refactored to support Concrete CMS version 9, is based on Bootstrap 5, and follows current best practices for Concrete CMS package development.

The add-on supports three types of shortcodes: simple text shortcodes that replace placeholders with static or dynamic text; PHP shortcodes that execute user-defined PHP code at runtime; and event-based shortcodes that allow developers to register and resolve custom placeholders via the event system.

Shortcodes can be used in any HTML content or editor—such as content blocks, templates, or programmatically—and are automatically resolved when the page is rendered.

This add-on is released under the Commercial Extension License. The original work by A3020 laid the foundation for this redevelopment and is gratefully acknowledged.
